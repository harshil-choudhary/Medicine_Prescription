You can find the apk file in root by the name "app-release.apk"

Screenshots are in the screenshots folder

The app has been tested on the android emulator Nexus_5X_API_29_x86

Main app is written in App.js and has 2 seperate screens. Namely, HomeScreen.js and MedicationScreen.js.

I have used React Navigation for this porjetc and have used FlatScreen and Bottom Navigation Bar as the major elements
